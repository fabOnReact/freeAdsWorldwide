image 

Search images based on the company and the language fields 
Load image - Image.where(:language => "Italian")

riparare contatore volantini distribuiti

ricontare i caratteri 
fare un editing del paintshop e mostrarlo agli utenti 

pensare se vale la pena riabilitare la validazione

you need to be able to see them easily in a screen or get a notification

---------------- Next Task --------------------------------
maybe in the future build a radio button to let user have automatically the startups selected

Think about the next project. Do some rating and maybe build quickly
some landing pages.. think about it and work on it.. you have 2 days


method: :get from new_company link on the bottom

devise flash error is not very nice

think about the image on the front page and maybe use cdn if it is
better for performances

Add transition to the jquery effect for the navbarLinks
class added in the application script

globalize

companies fields will be translated in different languages
		  website translated in qr code.
translation of ads globalize
login with facebook
reputation points system 	with merit
geolocation on mobile

make an effect with js to highlight the different thing that 
needs to be done..

A status and color of the print should be changed.. it should be 
clear that some sort of confirmation that the run was completed
should be made

---------------- Basic Info ------------------------------------
---------------- Later-------------------------------------

Should i save the pdf to the database?

dashboard
generate there a devise users controller 
in the users#index you will show:
1. that user startups and where they got the maximum number of visits 
2. The first 3 ads that got the maximum number of visits
3. Other startups ordered by number of visits
4. startups that are giving the maximum number of visits

maybe a video

---------------- Bugs--------------------------------------

companies links if your remove from new company the method: get
then the submit will not work

on mobile if you click a link then the tollbar does not hide
after reloading

validations on url

landings#index takes 15 ms just to redirect the user to another page

when you click the print botton set the effect to have jquery
ui toggle effect

Tooltip does not work and also the class for the association

Capybara can not test the selection in the sign up so i disabled 
the validation on the country select. fix it..

The sidebar background image is saved in an attribute 
data-image which between on line and the other is lost, but
fixed with the css background image property

You removed the validation to the company users association

The links in the sidebar are highlighted only when the 
url is exactly the same. Try fixing your js with Regex match

Sometimes you can not click the menu sign

fix bug companies destroy and other bugs

improve content_for right now you should find a way to include h4
in the formheader and pass a variable for the yield()
