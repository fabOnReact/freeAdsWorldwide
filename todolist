---------------- Task To Do-------------------------------------

Create an Ad(automatic) -> Generate an ad ID -> create a Qr Code

you need to build a mechanism to fill the runs with Ads based on 
some criteria

run is created and saved
I need to fill it with n Ads and select the ones from users that 
have most visits

criterias:
1. campaigntype_id = @run.campaigntype_id
2. company_id != @run.company_id

1. Campaign.givenvisits Decreasing order 
2. Number of Run status printed/completed/archived Decreasing order
3. Campaigns.adsreceived Increasing order



Prawn â€“ the user will be able to download it, I will flag it as 
printed and if needed he can download it again. Pop up alert saying 
that he should do this run only once, not more.. he will not get 
more ads distributed worldwide otherwise. 
Add status to Run and other infos

---------------- Next Task --------------------------------

Dopo di cui devi gestire il print button e magari segnarti quelle
che sono state stampate e quelle che sono ancora da stampare

Solo una run all volta se no la run deve essere cancellata quindi
validazione di unicita e campo printed/completed

companies fields will be translated in different languages
		  website translated in qr code.
translation of ads globalize
creation of the qr code - mozilla session called qr code name
creation of a printing list with correct format and qr code, number on each page
generation of pdf - prawn
login with facebook

---------------- Basic Info ------------------------------------
The dashboard will show all the locations available in a list and the Campaigns.
It will show Marketing Campaign Data (secondary, develop later). If absent it will show some data about the Cities and App Stats
Hear the user can configure Marketing Campaign Settings and Preferences
	- which city/countries to target 
	- run settings, how many ads they want to print in their own city and how many they want to send globally
	- print run botton, settings will come up and the user need to choose how many ads to print in this run
---------------- Later-------------------------------------
maybe a video
twitter, facebook page etc... email

landing page
fix the parallax on mobile 
---------------- Bugs--------------------------------------
Capybara can not test the selection in the sign up so i disabled 
the validation on the country select. fix it..

The sidebar background image is saved in an attribute 
data-image which between on line and the other is lost, but
fixed with the css background image property

You removed the validation to the company users association

The links in the sidebar are highlighted only when the 
url is exactly the same. Try fixing your js with Regex match

Sometimes you can not click the menu sign

fix bug companies destroy and other bugs

improve content_for right now you should find a way to include h4
in the formheader and pass a variable for the yield()
