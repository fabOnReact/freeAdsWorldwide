create new branch

add click event to script funciton on the button click

selection of companies

I am thinking of rewriting the runs#create method.. as when rendering
error messages does not work well.. maybe I just add 6 fields to the run
first company second company third company
first number of prints second number of prints third number of prints

1 form for selecting companies
run --> firstpartner:integer secondpartner:integer thirpartner:integer
2 rails g model company_run run_id:integer company_id:integer printnumber:integer
  run has_and_belongs_to_many companies_runs
  column with company name (it will include also your company)
  column with number of copies
4 city 
5 location
6 LANGUAGE OF THE ADS - Standard preselected English
  iso:string name:string 

  The user selects the language he want to print the fliers 
	run will have a belongs_to language
	run new will have a select for the language field
	EN IT TL SV
  
  Language has_many :runs
	

6 submit to runs#create with all the other values, no need for ownads and run print number

7 in runs#create I call Run.manualAds(run)
8 manualAds(run) selects those performs and each loop for everyone of those companies
9 Run is saved and Ads are saved
10 If statement to redirect correctly the user `unless @run.language == "EN"' the redirect to new_translation

translation of the ads - additional field for the description translation

1 translation model
	fields: language_id:integer translation:string

	translation belongs_to :language
	translation belongs_to :company
	language has_many :translations
	company has_many :translations

	ad.company.translations.where(:language.iso => @run.languge.iso)

2 new_translation form
	select the @run = current_user.runs.last
	@run.ads.each do |ad|
		ad.description
	1 column for each desciption - input disabled
		ad.company.translations.where(:language.iso => @run.languge.iso)
	1 column for the translation - will display the text translated, the user can edit it - mandatory field, can not be blank
	1 submit

3 post translations#create

	saves the translations in the table

4 runs#show calls RunPdf.new(@run, @ads)
5 runpdf will print ad.company.translations.where(:language.iso => @run.languge.iso))
5 test the app and maybe bring to production


selection of the ads to print
snapcode
explanation on how to scan the snapcode + translation

riparare contatore volantini distribuiti

---------------- Next Task --------------------------------
maybe in the future build a radio button to let user have automatically the startups selected

Think about the next project. Do some rating and maybe build quickly
some landing pages.. think about it and work on it.. you have 2 days


method: :get from new_company link on the bottom

devise flash error is not very nice

think about the image on the front page and maybe use cdn if it is
better for performances

Add transition to the jquery effect for the navbarLinks
class added in the application script

globalize

companies fields will be translated in different languages
		  website translated in qr code.
translation of ads globalize
login with facebook
reputation points system 	with merit
geolocation on mobile

make an effect with js to highlight the different thing that 
needs to be done..

A status and color of the print should be changed.. it should be 
clear that some sort of confirmation that the run was completed
should be made

---------------- Basic Info ------------------------------------
---------------- Later-------------------------------------

Should i save the pdf to the database?

dashboard
generate there a devise users controller 
in the users#index you will show:
1. that user startups and where they got the maximum number of visits 
2. The first 3 ads that got the maximum number of visits
3. Other startups ordered by number of visits
4. startups that are giving the maximum number of visits

maybe a video
twitter, facebook page etc... email

---------------- Bugs--------------------------------------

on mobile if you click a link then the tollbar does not hide
after reloading

validations on url

landings#index takes 15 ms just to redirect the user to another page

when you click the print botton set the effect to have jquery
ui toggle effect

Tooltip does not work and also the class for the association

Capybara can not test the selection in the sign up so i disabled 
the validation on the country select. fix it..

The sidebar background image is saved in an attribute 
data-image which between on line and the other is lost, but
fixed with the css background image property

You removed the validation to the company users association

The links in the sidebar are highlighted only when the 
url is exactly the same. Try fixing your js with Regex match

Sometimes you can not click the menu sign

fix bug companies destroy and other bugs

improve content_for right now you should find a way to include h4
in the formheader and pass a variable for the yield()
