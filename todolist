---------------- Bugs--------------------------------------

on mobile if you click a link then the tollbar does not hide
after reloading

validations on url

landings#index takes 15 ms just to redirect the user to another page

when you click the print botton set the effect to have jquery
ui toggle effect

Tooltip does not work and also the class for the association

Capybara can not test the selection in the sign up so i disabled 
the validation on the country select. fix it..

The sidebar background image is saved in an attribute 
data-image which between on line and the other is lost, but
fixed with the css background image property

You removed the validation to the company users association

The links in the sidebar are highlighted only when the 
url is exactly the same. Try fixing your js with Regex match

Sometimes you can not click the menu sign

fix bug companies destroy and other bugs

improve content_for right now you should find a way to include h4
in the formheader and pass a variable for the yield()
