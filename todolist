---------------- Basic Info ------------------------------------
The dashboard will show all the locations available in a list and the Campaigns.
It will show Marketing Campaign Data (secondary, develop later). If absent it will show some data about the Cities and App Stats
Hear the user can configure Marketing Campaign Settings and Preferences
	- which city/countries to target 
	- run settings, how many ads they want to print in their own city and how many they want to send globally
	- print run botton, settings will come up and the user need to choose how many ads to print in this run
---------------- Later-------------------------------------

in the users#index you will show:
1. that user startups and where they got the maximum number of visits 
2. The first 3 ads that got the maximum number of visits

3. Other startups ordered by number of visits

4. startups that are giving the maximum number of visits


dashboard

maybe a video
twitter, facebook page etc... email

options are : small qr, 2 qr for page and 1 page with many info
and a small qr.. Smaller the qr easier to scan.

---------------- Bugs--------------------------------------

validations on url

landings#index takes 15 ms just to redirect the user to another page

when you click the print botton set the effect to have jquery
ui toggle effect

Tooltip does not work and also the class for the association

Capybara can not test the selection in the sign up so i disabled 
the validation on the country select. fix it..

The sidebar background image is saved in an attribute 
data-image which between on line and the other is lost, but
fixed with the css background image property

You removed the validation to the company users association

The links in the sidebar are highlighted only when the 
url is exactly the same. Try fixing your js with Regex match

Sometimes you can not click the menu sign

fix bug companies destroy and other bugs

improve content_for right now you should find a way to include h4
in the formheader and pass a variable for the yield()
